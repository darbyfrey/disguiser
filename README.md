# Disguiser

![disguiser]("src/icons/icon-src.png")

Disguiser is a simple Chrome extension that will allow you to trigger specified links to load in an incognito window. This can be useful if you don't want the browser session to persist to the new page.

## Installation

This extension is still pretty new and it might be buggy, so I haven't put it in the Extensions store yet. If you want to try it out, you can [download it here]("bin/disguiser.crx"). Then, drag the file on to the extensions manager to install it.

## Usage

Once you have it installed, just add a class of `.disguiser` to any `a` tags on your page. When clicked, those links will be loaded in an incognito window.
